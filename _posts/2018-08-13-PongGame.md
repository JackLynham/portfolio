**Pong Game** The classic game "Pong" recreated by me. The game has single and multiplayer options. The balls can also collide while travelling making for interesting and unique gameplay.<br/>


#### What techniques did i use?
- Vectors
- Bounding Boxes
- Collision Detection (Registers when the ball hits another ball/paddle.)
<br/>


#### How do we check the click is within sprite bounding box?
I used AABB bounding boxes to check the collision of two objects. I would pass the position of two objects into a boolean function. If the objects are inside each other the function would return true and run the appropriate c e.g. change direction.


#### How do we reset position?
When the ball goes of the screen the ball will be reset with reversed vectors in the centre of the screen.
